# ES6 Package Starter

This project is a simple starter kit for building packages in ES6 to be published to npm.

## Get Started
1. **Clone the project**. `git clone https://github.com/danny-hines/es6-package-starter.git`
2. **Install dependencies**. `npm install`
3. **Start the watch tasks**. `npm start`
As you develop your project, this command will watch all of your files and automatically run linting and tests whenever you hit save.
4. **Review the sample code**. This project includes a simple Add function along with a corresponding spec file.
5. **Replace with your own code**. You can now begin writing your package, replacing the sample code. As long as the start command is running, any changes you make will automatically trigger your tests and linting.

## Core Dependencies 
|**Package**|**Description**|
|-----------|---------------|
| [Babel](http://babeljs.io) | Compiles ES6 to ES5 so that your package can be used in environments where the latest language features may yet to be supported. |
| [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) | Automated tests with [expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) for very terse assertions. |
| [ESLint](http://eslint.org) | Pluggable linting utility for JavaScript to help enforce code quality. |
